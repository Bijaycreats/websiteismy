        My name is Bijay Khanal. I am just 12 years old. I stay with my father, mother, and my brother.<br>
        <i>I live in Ramapur. It is the most beautiful, just like my girlfriend.</i><br>
        I have written a poem:

        <b>A lot believe, MATH is tough</b><br>
        <i>
        I smiled and said, “No it’s not!”<br>
        Numbers --- it’s like counting stars<br>
        Don’t over analyze, come back from Mars<br><br>
        English is none<br>
        But science is easy to learn<br>
        Science is a piece of gun<br>
        But occupation was fun<br><br>
        I don’t know, what is coding<br>
        But social period is too much boring<br>
        Board exams are coming near<br>
        But we don’t have any fear<br>

    <h3>Three Simple Rules</h3>
    <p>
        Once, there was a rich man in a village. His name was Chulong. Despite being rich, he still wanted more riches and money.<br><br>
        One day, he was walking in his garden. He saw a strange bird in a bush. It was very small, but it had beautiful and colorful feathers. Its voice was also very sweet. Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life. He slowly went near the bush unseen and caught the bird. The bird spoke, “Why have you caught me?”<br><br>
        “I want to make money. I can sell you for a big amount,” replied Chulong.<br>
        “But you are already rich. Why do you want more?” asked the bird.<br>
